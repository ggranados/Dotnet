# Simple Rest Controller Example

In your command prompt, run the following command:

~~~
dotnet run
~~~

You should see an output similar to the following:

~~~
Command prompt
Building...
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
Now listening on: http://localhost:5020
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
Hosting environment: Development
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
Content root path: C:\Users\Ana\MyMicroservice\
~~~


In this example, it showed that it was listening on port 5020, so the following image shows the URL http://localhost:5020/WeatherForecast.

The API endpoint returns JSON data containing weather forecast informationÂ´
